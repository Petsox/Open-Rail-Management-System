# Open-Rail-Management-System

ORMS is a Lua Program for OpenComputers 1.7 and newer. Its main purpose is to control your minecraft railway including signals and switches from one place with just your mouse.
</br>
</br>
Tested and developed on Minecraft 1.7.10

This project uses the [LibGrapes](https://github.com/ApelSoftCorp/LibGrapes) library, making the [MineOS](https://github.com/IgorTimofeev/MineOS) GUI library available under OpenOS

THIS VERSION DOESN'T SUPPORT RAILCRAFT SIGNALS, ONLY SIGNALCRAFT ONES! IF YOU WANT TO USE RAILCRAFT SIGNALS, USE THE OLD VERSION [HERE](https://github.com/Petsox/Open-Rail-Management-System/tree/master)

When you have all the mods installed, make a computer with an <b>internet card, display, GPU, CPU, memory, HDD</b>

Then, install OpenOS using the OpenOS floppy and run the following command, which will automatically install ORMS into <i>/home/orms</i>:

	wget -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Petsox/Open-Rail-Management-System/new-master/installer.lua /tmp/installer.lua && /tmp/installer.lua

 Alternatively, if the Github installer doesn't work (you are getting a certificate error), you may try the alternative Pastebin installer, which will also install ORMS into <i>/home/orms</i>:

 	pastebin run -f iQAC8EfE
</br>

Make a Digital Crossing Controller named "Crossings", a Universal Digital Controller named "Switches" and a Digital Controller named "Signals" (all from SignalCraft-Integrations), and connect them to the computer with a cable from the top

Then insert your ORMS layout into config.lua generated using the tool below.

ORMS Layout Generator is available [here](https://petsox.github.io/ORMS-Layout-Generator-Web-Edition/)
